# Agent Guidelines

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Request organization
- Place each new request in a subfolder under `/examples` using the pattern `NNN-<request-name>` (e.g., `001-landing-page`).
- If a request number is provided (e.g., `001`), search `/examples` for an existing folder that starts with that prefix and use it. If no folder exists, create a new one with that prefix.
- When no request number is given, create a new folder using the next sequential three-digit prefix after the current highest.

## Project format
- Each project should be a self-contained HTML demo (single HTML file). Name the main file `index.html` within the request folder.
- Keep any assets needed by that project inside the same request folder to maintain isolation.
